This project contains a small Cucumber + Selenium test framework (Java, Maven) with Page Object Model structure.

Artifacts produced by test runs
- HTML report (Cucumber runner): `target/cucumber-report.html`
- JSON report for advanced reporting: `target/cucumber-report.json`
- Enhanced HTML report (cucumber-reporting): `target/cucumber-report/index.html` (generated in the `verify` phase)
- Screenshots: `target/screenshots/` â€” screenshots are saved per scenario; the final screenshot for each scenario is attached to the Cucumber report.

How to run tests
```bash
cd /path/to/cucumber-selenium
mvn clean test
```

After tests finish
- Open the basic Cucumber HTML: `target/cucumber-report.html`
- For the enhanced report generated by cucumber-reporting, open: `target/cucumber-report/index.html`

Convert frames to MP4 (if you ever capture frames)
1. Extract the frames (if you have a frames directory):
```bash
ffmpeg -r 10 -i frame-%05d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
```

Notes
- SLF4J warnings are minimized by including `slf4j-api` and `slf4j-simple`.
- Selenium may warn about CDP versions; this can be silenced by adding a matching `selenium-devtools-vXX` dependency aligned with your Chrome version.
